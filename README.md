# Hi, I'm Farimah Dabiri  

I'm an MSc student in Urban and Regional Planning at Politecnico di Torino, focusing on  
geospatial analysis, Python-based environmental modelling, remote sensing workflows,  
and climate-related spatial research.

My work combines GIS, Earth Observation, and data-driven methods to study how environmental  
and hydroclimate patterns affect land, infrastructure, and communities.

## Research Interests
- Hydroclimate variability and climate extremes  
- Remote sensing (Landsat OLI, DEM/DSM processing)  
- Geospatial data science and raster analysis  
- Urban climate processes and UHI modelling  
- Data-driven environmental and climate modelling  

---

## Technical Skills
Python: NumPy, Pandas, Rasterio, GeoPandas, Matplotlib  
GIS: QGIS, ArcGIS, DEM/DSM processing, raster workflows  
Remote Sensing: Landsat preprocessing, NDWI/LST extraction  
Modelling: Grasshopper + Ladybug for environmental and solar simulation  
Tools: Git, Jupyter Notebook

## Selected Projects
### Urban Heat Island (UHI) Analysis  
Landsat-based surface temperature extraction, hotspot mapping, and terrain correlation analysis.

### Flood Mapping Using Landsat OLI  
NDWI-based flood extent delineation and visualization for hazard assessment.

### DEM Terrain Modelling  
Slope/aspect modelling, hillshade generation, and terrain-based environmental indicators.

### Solar and Microclimate Modelling  
Ladybug/Grasshopper workflows to explore shading, radiation, and microclimate impacts.
